This is my first weekly self-study update for the automatic HSM group. I apologize for updating so late, weekend was
a bit busy.

	This week I checked out a book called "Engineering a Compiler" by Cooper and Torezon and was able to get through the
first 3 chapters. I got an overview of what a compiler does and familiarized myself with all its moving parts.
The book went into some depth about the scanning and parsing stages of a compiler. I also touched on some of the
subsequent analysis and annotations added to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that can make working with intermediate
representations and doing optimizations easier down the line.

	Additionally, I've been going through an online resource called "Crafting Interpreters" to create a simple interpreter
for the authors language, Lox, in Java. Many of the same concepts apply for compiler and interpreters in the beginning stages
so it has been very useful for getting some hands on experience.

	In the coming week I will continue to go through the resources I mentioned above. I also plan to begin going through
Professor Dewey's videos on HSMs.
